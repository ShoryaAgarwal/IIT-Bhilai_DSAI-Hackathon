# Project Title: BhilaiGPT: IIT Bhilai Query Resolver

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create BhilaiGPT, a software system that resolves non-confidential queries related to IIT Bhilai by providing accurate and up-to-date information. The system will accept user queries in text or audio format and respond with the relevant information extracted from documents available on the IIT Bhilai website.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
